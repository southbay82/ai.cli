I want to create a design spec for a cli tool which has both command switches and a menu to manage various AI tools such as gemini, amazon q for cli, windsurf. The tool should have the following capabilities. General shared content for 'profiles', 'rules', mcps, workflows which are a series of prompts for an LLM that act like a 'macro' this is a windsurf specific feature bother other tools may have something similiar. The tool will be public on github, and provide features to do 'global management of mcps', profiles. Project specific management of mcps, rules, workflows or other features we should consider such as hooks/call backs to agents or other tooling. The tool should be simple as well, it should check if the local repo is updated, if not sync it with git. It should have a simple 'sync-all' feature will updates or installs the content the user has. It can update the project/workspace specific rules, mcps, workflows to a project. This latter part is important to allow for project specific functionality versus global functionality. The tool should also be driven by a command called 'ai.cli' which takes params or without params starts up a menu. This tool should be added to the user's shell path. The tool should also manage a personal access token file for the MCPs or other tool integrations making it simpel to add new personal access tokens. This file should be deployed to ~/.ai.cli. The tool should make backups of the various managed directies, and maintain 5 backups for any changes to mcps, rules, workflows globaly, or within the project. store this prompt to a file, then build the plan.
